# Plotly-Dash

## Introduction

Some data, like time series data, might be more interesting to view in a dashboard setup. A tool which makes this very easy is [plotly-dash](https://plotly.com/examples/). This open-source python library makes it easy to create HTML dashboard using plotly graphs. in the python file "dash-example.py" you can find a very simple dashboard which shows the data of the water potability dataset depending on the selected metric. Your exercise will be to recreate the following dashboard with the DehliClimate dataset.

You have to create four graphs that give more information about the DehliClimate dataset. The first graph shows all weather data depending on the time given on the [range slider](https://blog.finxter.com/plotly-dash-slider-components/). Next, you have a graph which shows the selected metric for both the training and test set. Underneath you find a correlation matrix and a [boxplot](https://plotly.com/python/box-plots/). The boxplot also shows the plot of the selected metric. 

Use the dash example python file as a start and the given links as help to create your dashboard. If you are done with these graphs, feel free to look at the [plotly dash website](https://plotly.com/examples/) and create some other interactive graphs.
