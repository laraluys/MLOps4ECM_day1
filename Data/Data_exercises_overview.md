# Data Exercises

These exercises will show you how to label, explore, preprocess and version you dataset with the use from some tools. Start with the label-studio.md file to learn how to label your dataset with label-studio. Then, explore a table and image datasets in the Exploration_images.ipynb and Exploration_table.ipynb notebooks. After this, you can read about DVC in the DVC.md file. With this information you can start preprocessing your datasets in the preprocessing_table.ipynb and preprocessing_images.ipynb notebooks. You can implement your new knowledge about DVC whilst cleaning these datasets. The last exercise is an exercise about creating a visualization dashboard using plotly-dash which is explained in the plotly-dash.md file and uses the dash-example.py file.
